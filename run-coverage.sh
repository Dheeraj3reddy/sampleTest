# This script is for running the project's test coverage report after the build.
# The developer can expect the build results are already in place, and they can
# run anything here to get coverage report done. So far, only Coveralls is
# supported by the static pipeline. We will soon support SonarQube as well.

# Sample command for running unit test with coverage and push the coverage
# data to Coveralls server. Here it is assumed you have the script
# "test:coveralls" defined in package.json.
#
# npm run test:coveralls
